Runway provides a couple of fieldtypes, mostly for things like Eloquent relations.

## BelongsTo fieldtype

This fieldtypes allows you to select a single model for a `belongsTo` Eloquent relationship.

### Configuration
Itâ€™s important that when configuring this fieldtype, the handle of the field is the same as the `belongsTo` column name, eg: `category_id`.

Also when configuring the fieldtype, you may choose the resource you wish to be available for selection by the user.
