Runway is a Statamic addon that lets you manage your Eloquent models in Statamic, as if they were entries in a collection.

## Edit models in the Control Panel

Runway lets you edit your Eloquent models from the Control Panel. Use your own blueprints for models, apply query scopes to the listing table & run custom actions.

## Relationship fieldtypes

Have multiple `Video` models that belong to a `Course`? Who'd have guessed you'd be able to manage them directly in the CP?

## Routing

If you want it, Runway can setup routing for your models so it feels all Statamic-y. Fields will be automagically augmented & you'll have the full power of Antlers.

## GraphQL

If you're running headless, Runway will also make your models available via Statamic's GraphQL endpoint.
