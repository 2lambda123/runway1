## v2.0.0 (2021-05-24)

Runway 2 introduces some minor breaking changes. Including a minimum requirement for Statamic 3.1 and the fact `models` are now called `resources` in the config (which our upgrade script should automate for you).

### What's new?

* [Front-end routing](https://github.com/doublethreedigital/runway/tree/2.0#routing)

### What's improved?

* Models are now 'Resources' - this will be reflected in your config file, it's essentially to stop you getting mixed up between a Runway Model and an Eloquent model
* Resources aren't just a big old arrays anymore ðŸ˜…
* The Publish Forms in the CP are now Runway's (to allow for extra functionality)

### Upgrade Guide

Upgrading to v2.0 is reasonably simple. In your `composer.json` file, update the `doublethreedigital/runway` version constraint:

```json
"doublethreedigital/runway": "2.0.*"
```

Then run:

```
composer update doublethreedigital/runway --with-dependencies
```

Because of the magic of Statamic's new [Upgrade Scripts](https://statamic.dev/upgrade-guide-3-0-to-3-1#update-scripts), all config changes will be automatically made.

## v2.0.0-beta.2 (2021-05-20)

### What's new

* Upgrade script to change `models` to `resources` in config
* Ability to disable Runway's migrations

## v2.0.0-beta.1 (2021-05-15)
